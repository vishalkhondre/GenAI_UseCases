# GenAI_UseCases
Generative AI (GenAI) use cases across different stages of the SDLC.

# Breakdown of the columns in your Excel sheet:

* **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Stage:**

This column identifies the stage in the SDLC where generative AI can be applied, such as "Analyze," "Design," "Build," etc. Each stage represents a critical phase in the software creation process, from initial discovery to deployment and maintenance.

* **Activity Group:**

Within each SDLC stage, activities are grouped based on their relatedness. For example, in the "Analyze" stage, there could be groups like "Discovery and Inception." These groups encapsulate a set of related activities that together achieve specific goals, making it easier to categorize the ways AI can improve these processes.

* **Milestone:**

Each activity group is broken down into specific milestones. A milestone represents a significant checkpoint or goal within that group, such as "Customer Research." Milestones help track progress and ensure that key objectives are met before moving to the next step.

* **Representative Tasks:**

Tasks are the actual actions carried out to achieve the milestones. This column lists the individual tasks, such as "Conducting User Interviews" or "Organizing Focus Groups." These are the areas where AI can assist by automating or enhancing the task execution.

* **How Gen AI Can Be Used:**

This column highlights the potential ways generative AI can improve task execution. It covers specific AI techniques, such as "AI-based transcription and summarization tools" or "AI-driven sentiment analysis." These methods aim to reduce manual effort, increase accuracy, and provide valuable insights.

* **Impact:**

The impact column outlines the benefits of using AI for the identified tasks, such as "Reduced manual effort in summarizing and extracting insights" or "More accurate predictions of user behavior." It emphasizes how AI increases efficiency, improves decision-making, and accelerates the completion of milestones.

* **Reference Gen AI Tools:**

This column lists specific AI tools or platforms that can be used to achieve the desired outcomes. Examples include "Otter.ai," "Amplitude," and "MonkeyLearn." These tools serve as practical solutions that can be implemented to realize the benefits of generative AI in the SDLC.
